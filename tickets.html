                    <p>How to get your one-time Ov-chipcard:</p>
                    <p>This is a one-time OV-chip card that you can buy at any Dutch NS train station. You have to pay an extra €1 on top of the normal price. The ticket is made of card with a chip inside and shows the date and your trip. You can buy it on the day you travel or up to a week before. To use it, you have to tap it on the card readers near the platform or at the gate when you start and finish your trip. After you're done, you throw the card away because you can't use it again.</p>

                    <p>Reusable Ov-chipcard:</p>
                    <p>OV-chip card / OV-pay for trains in the Netherlands. The OV-chip card is a special card for getting around in the Netherlands. You can put money on it, and then use it to pay for your train ride by tapping the card when you start and finish your trip at two stations. There are personal and anonymous cards you can choose from. You can buy an empty OV-chip card for €7.50. It lasts 4-5 years, and you can put up to €150 on it. For trains, you need at least €20 on the card.</p>
                    <p>To check in, tap the card on the reader—it will beep once, and €20 will be taken as a deposit. If something goes wrong, it will beep 3 times. When you check out, it beeps twice, shows the fare, and gives back the extra money. The card works for all public transport in the Netherlands, and you need at least €4 for other trips.</p>
